These are the steps to properly setup a test of wolfssl in RIOT OS:

To test wolfSSL in RIOT build system get the RIOT source code from here:
git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT

Then cd RIOT/examples

clone wolfssl in that directory. You should end up with RIOT/examples/wolfssl

git clone https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl

cd <path-to>/RIOT/examples/wolfssl/RIOT_Make/testsuite

run the script ./wolf-build-and-run-test.sh

That script will perform the following steps:
1. copy the source files from:
    <wolfssl-root>/src
    <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/src
    <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/test
    <wolfssl-root>/testsuite
    <wolfssl-root>/examples/[ echoserver/echoclient/client/server ]

2. Use the provided Makefile to build the example application:
    "testwolfcrypt.elf"
    This application will be located here:
    <path-to>/RIOT/examples/wolfssl/RIOT_Make/wolfcrypt-test/bin/native/testwolfcrypt.elf

3. Execute that application. You should see a pass or fail.

4. Lastly that script will cleanup the source files it copied in for building.
    NOTE: this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to prevent making changes on temporary
            files. All development changes should be made to the actual source
            files located in their respective directories:
            <wolfssl-root>/src
            <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/src
            <wolfssl-root>/wolfcrypt/test
            <wolfssl-root>/testsuite
            <wolfssl-root>/examples/[ echoserver/echoclient/client/server ]
            Then the script "wolf-build-and-run-test.sh" should be run again to
            test those changes
            If you do make changes to the temporary files those changes will be
            ignored by <wolfssl-root>/.gitignore


NOTE: This test is only for the "native" test. To build for a specific platform
        cd to RIOT directory and run "make doc" to generate doxygen docs.
        (You will need to install doxygen if you don't have it already)
        Then open the file: RIOT/doc/doxygen/html/index.html

        This will provide you with the necessary help to setup and build for a
        specific platform
